## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository is a personal archive of blockchain study notes, summaries, and technical walkthroughs. I share any insights I extract from my learning journeyâ€”whether it's about smart contracts, cross-chain protocols, token standards, or blockchain architecture. The goal is to help others who are exploring the space, especially those looking for simplified, example-rich explanations.

I actively use AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to support my research, clarify concepts, and organize my documentation. I highly recommend using AI to accelerate learning, troubleshoot code, and generate educational content. Every file here reflects a mix of personal effort and AI-assisted clarity.
